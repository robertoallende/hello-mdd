# Unit 1: Hello Languages File

## Objective
Create a comprehensive text file containing "Hello" greetings from as many human languages as possible, formatted for easy random selection by the Python script.

## Implementation
Will create `hellos.txt` with format `Language: Greeting` to provide both the greeting and educational context. Each line will contain one language-greeting pair, using proper UTF-8 encoding to support international characters and scripts.

The file should include greetings from major world languages, regional languages, and some less common languages to provide diversity and educational value. Languages should span different language families (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Afro-Asiatic, etc.) and writing systems (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese characters, etc.).

## AI Interactions
Will use AI to compile greetings from diverse world languages, ensuring proper spelling and cultural appropriateness. Focus on common, respectful greetings that are widely recognized in each language community.

## Files Modified
- To create: `hellos.txt` - Main language greetings database

## Status: Planned
Ready to implement comprehensive greetings file with 50+ languages representing major world language families and regions.
