# Unit 3: README.md

## Objective
Create a comprehensive README.md file in the root of the repository to document the Universal Hello World project, explaining its purpose, usage, and implementation for users and contributors.

The README should be clear, concise, and welcoming to users who want to try the project or understand how it works.
