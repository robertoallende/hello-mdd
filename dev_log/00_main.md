# Project Plan and Dev Log

Universal Hello World - A simple script that greets you with "Hello" in a random human language, designed to run on as many devices and platforms as possible.

## Structure
Development is organized into sequential units following the `<sequence>_<unitname>[_subunit<number|name>].md` naming convention. Each unit represents a major development phase, with optional subunits for discrete implementation moments or iterations.

## About the Project
### What This Is
A universal greeting script that:
- Says "Hello" in a randomly selected human language
- Runs on maximum number of devices/platforms (phones, computers, servers, embedded systems)
- Requires minimal dependencies and system resources
- Provides a delightful, educational experience about world languages

### Architecture
- **Core Script**: Single executable that handles language selection and greeting
- **Language Database**: Comprehensive collection of "Hello" translations
- **Platform Compatibility**: Cross-platform execution with minimal dependencies
- **Deployment Options**: Multiple distribution methods for different platforms

### Technical Stack
**Primary Implementation Options:**
- **Python**: Excellent cross-platform support, pre-installed on many systems
- **Shell Script**: Universal on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, BSD)
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Cross-platform, good mobile support via Termux
- **Go**: Single binary, excellent cross-compilation support
- **C**: Maximum compatibility, compiles everywhere

**Distribution Methods:**
- Standalone executables for major platforms
- Package manager distributions (pip, npm, homebrew, apt)
- Web version for browsers
- Mobile app versions
