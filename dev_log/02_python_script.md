# Unit 2: Python Script

## Objective
Create a simple Python script that reads the hellos.txt file and randomly selects and displays one greeting, providing both the language name and the greeting for educational value.

## Implementation
Will create `hello.py` with the following approach:
- Use Python 3 as the target version
- Use Python's built-in `random` module for selection
- Read the entire hellos.txt file and split into lines
- Filter out empty lines for robustness
- Randomly select one line and display it
- Handle UTF-8 encoding properly for international characters
- Include basic error handling for missing file

The script should be intentionally minimal - just the core functionality needed to randomly greet the user in a world language.

## AI Interactions
Will use AI to write clean, simple Python code following best practices for file handling and random selection. Focus on readability and minimal dependencies (only standard library).

## Files Modified
- To create: `hello.py` - Main executable script

## Status: Planned
Ready to implement working Python script that randomly selects and displays greetings from the languages file.
